# MemoryInspector

-Works only on Windows filesystem

A small command line tool I wrote for myself to figure out what was occupying my disk space.
(there was a bug in McAfee webAdvisor logging files: https://forums.mcafee.com/t5/WebAdvisor/Why-is-Webadvisor-log-file-taking-more-than-85GB-Is-it-safe-to/td-p/692726)

I have used it many times to clean my drives, I find it usefull to search and prioritize stuff that I might want to remove. 

It creates a hierarchy of all the files in the selected drives, ordererd my memory occupied.
